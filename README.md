I'm currently learning how to code! 🧑🏻‍💻 I enjoy using creative solutions to solve real-life problems.  I bought my first computer 🖥️ at age 10 and have been obsessed with technology ever since.  When I'm not learning to code, I enjoy my AMC A-List pass 🎬, enjoy nature 🍃 and spend time with family & friends!
